Version 2 files of "keyboard.py" and "talker.py" now provide in conjunction a command line interface which allows the user to remotely send commands wirelessly to the car. Commands when running keyboard.py are as follows:

"s x": x is an arbitrary number which determines the speed of the car

"t x": x is an arbitrary number which determines the angle of the car

"c": provide a mode in which the car will drive around in a circle 

"x" will stop the car and quit the program
